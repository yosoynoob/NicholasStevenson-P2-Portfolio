    "text": "2.1 General Background Information\nI think it’s safe to say that many of us may be familiar with the movie Moneyball. The movie, based on the book of the same title, follows a team with one of the lowest payrolls in Major League Baseball as they catapult to the playoffs to compete for the championship against teams with unending resources. The team, the Oakland Athletics, was able to do this by using a more advanced statistical approach to evaluating players for their team. This allowed them to find hidden value in the player market that other teams were not aware of. This has always been fascinating and it led me to wonder how this might work in other leagues. I decided to take a closer look at the National Football League.\nWhile I will not be studying advanced football statistics to measure a player’s “hidden” value, I will be looking at where they rank in terms of salary and how much of an impact they have in their team’s winning percentage."

    "text": "2.3 Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed\nThe most obvious question is, do teams that spend the most on salary tend to have higher winning percentages? But the question that I will focus on is, where is the value? When you look at a winning team, there is generally a player, or a group of players, that are playing beyond their salary, i.e., these players are playing above expectations and are therefore considered a good or great value for their respective teams. Is there a common value among certain positions? Or is the value to be found in those players strictly on rookie contracts?\nTo cite other work (important everywhere, but likely happens first in introduction), make sure your references are in the bibtex file specified in the YAML header above (here dataanalysis_template_references.bib) and have the right bibtex key. Then you can include like this:\nExamples of reproducible research projects can for instance be found in (McKay, Ebell, Billings, et al., 2020; McKay, Ebell, Dale, Shen, & Handel, 2020)"

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful. So let’s fix that first.\n\nd1 &lt;- rawdata %&gt;% dplyr::filter( Height != \"sixty\" ) %&gt;% \n                  dplyr::mutate(Height = as.numeric(Height))\nskimr::skim(d1)\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nd1\n\n\nNumber of rows\n13\n\n\nNumber of columns\n5\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n2\n\n\nnumeric\n3\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\nGender\n0\n1\n1\n2\n0\n5\n0\n\n\nDating_App\n0\n1\n2\n6\n0\n3\n0\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nHeight\n0\n1.00\n151.62\n46.46\n6\n154.00\n165\n175\n192\n▁▁▁▂▇\n\n\nWeight\n1\n0.92\n647.92\n2000.48\n45\n54.75\n73\n90\n7000\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nAge\n0\n1.00\n33.38\n14.71\n16\n25.00\n28\n36\n74\n▇▇▁▁▁\n\n\n\n\nhist(d1$Height)\n\n\n\n\nNow we see that there is one person with a height of 6.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."
