This dataset of U.S. mortality trends since 1900 highlights the differences in age-adjusted death rates and life expectancy at birth by race and sex. The dataset contains 1,071 observations along with five columns. The five variables are `year`, `race`, `sex`, `average life expectancy`, and `age-adjusted death rate`.

The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Death-rates-and-life-expectancy-at-birth/w9j2-ggv5/about_data "Death rates and life expectancy at birth").
